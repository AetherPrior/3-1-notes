# L5
## Bayesian probability
  - We cant say something for certain
    - Eg all birds dont fly
        - Young / sick birds , or birds that dont fly
## Random variable
  ### 1. Discrete random variable
  - When a random variable takes discrete/countable values
    - all possible outcomes are listable without missing any
  ### 2. Continuous random variable
   - value of outcome of the experiment takes real values
     - as the set of real numbers is proved to be uncountable
## Probability Distribution
  - A table where you right all the values which the random variable takes, and the probabilities for each random variable

## Expectation of the random variable
   - mean of a discrete random variable p.d.
     - mean is the weighted sum of all the values of a P.D. , where the weight is the probabilities 
       - (weighted average in this case, when the weight is derived from probabilities) 
   - $E(X) = \mu = \sum_{all x} xP(x)$
   - $V(X) = \sigma^2 = \sum_{all x} (x-\mu)^2P(x)$

  - X, sales made in 3 attempts
    - X can take values 0,1,2,3
    - | $X$ | $0$ | $1$ | $2$ | $3$|
      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | P(X)|(4/5)^3|3\*4/5\*4/5*1/5|3\*4/5\*1/5\*1/5|(1/5)^3|
      |P(X)|0.512|0.384|0.096|0.008|
   
    - $E(X) = 0(.512) + 1(.384) + 2(.096) + 3(0.008)$
    - $= 0.6$ - which means she makes .6 sales per call
      - doesn't actually make sense _per_ call
      - but over many calls yes.
    - safe to assume that the 3 events (calls) are independent i.e. one doesn't influence the other
