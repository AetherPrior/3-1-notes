# L5
- performance of many apps (29 as of 2006 spec) compressed into a single number
- spec uses geometric mean (GM) 
    - $\sqrt[n]{sr_1*sr_2*....sr_n}$, 
    
  where $sr$ is exec time/refernce time
  reference time is the time taken to exec the program on the SPEC benchmark system

- Arithmetic mean is also popular but not good
- Weighted A.M. is better.

## Execution time after improvement
  - Execution time unaffected (which is part of the program that cannot be parallelised) + {Exec time Affected/ Rate of improvement}
  - If a certain part of a program eg. multiply has 80% of the exec time, we can't achieve - like a 5 fold enhancement, if 80% can't be parallelized

  Amdahl's law says
  Let,
   > $T_b$ -> execution before improvement
   $f$ -> fraction that can be improved
   $T_a$ -> After improvement
   $s_f$ -> Speedup factor

   $T_b\: = (1-f)T_b\: + fT_b$
   $T_a\: = (1-f)T_b\: + f\frac{T_b}{s_f}$ 
   $1 =  (1-f)s_o\:+ fs_o/s_f$
   where $s_o = T_b/T_a$

   $\large s_o = \frac{1}{((1-f) + f/s_f)}$

   max speedup will go to 1/(1-f)
   sf $\alpha$ 1/(no. of cores) in theory, but actually its performance is lesser

   the theoretical usage drops after some time and is shown by the amdahl's law graph
