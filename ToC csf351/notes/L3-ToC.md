# L3
1. Sets
2. Relations
3. Functions
4. Binary relation
5. Relations can be represented as directed graphs

### Reflexive 
  - $R \subset A \times A$ ,  $(a,a)\in R$

### Antisymmetric
  - $R \subset A \times A$ and if $(a,b) \in R \implies (b,a) \not\in R$
  
### Partial Order relationship
  - Reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive
  - $\left\{(a,b): a,b \in Z, a>=b \right\}$ 

 ### Total order
  - Is a partial order relation
  - $a,b \in A$, either $a,b \in R$
  or $b,a \in R$ 
  - The ancestral relationship when we have siblings is not total
  - $\le$ is a toset 

### Language
  - Symbols are used to represent sounds of the alphabet
  - Alphabet is a finite set of symbols
  - A string over an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet
  - language is a semantic ordering of a subset of all combinations of strings
