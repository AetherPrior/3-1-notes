# L4
$\sum$ = $\left\{a,b,c \right\}$ 

$\Sigma^*$ denotes all strings that can be formed using $\Sigma$

Hence a language is any set of strings over an alphabet $\Sigma$ that is any subset of $\Sigma^*$. Hence  $\Sigma^*$, $\Sigma$, and $\phi$ also are languages 

Most of the languages are infinite
Ex. List all binary strings formed over $\{0,1\}$
It is not possible
$L=\left\{w: w \in \Sigma^* \right\}$
The general form is $L=\left\{w: w \in \Sigma^* and\: w\: has\: property\: P\right\}$
