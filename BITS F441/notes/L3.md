# L5
- Vision Cortex
- Auditory Cortex
- Somatosensory cortex
these guys can learn other senses when their primary functions are severed

   - So there may be just one algo behind this
- Perception based algorithms
  - Eg. recognising text and stuff

- focus onto the given problem is going down, but it's not
  - $\implies$ We can't say much about DL
  - We need to tune our DL algorithm, but we can't do a one-for-all algo

Pack learning , Bounce of learning etc.
No free lunch theorem
  - averaging over all possible data generation distributions, Every classification algorithm has the same error rate, classifying previously unobserved points.
    - you should not look for a universal learning algorithm

  - There is a proof

DL - did better than SVM for handwriting recognition
TL;DR - DL is kinda scam term only for nicer NN
