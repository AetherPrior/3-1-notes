# T2
- TIOB
## Comments - single line/ multiline
  - Single line simplicity 
     - cant deal with block comments
  - Multiline - nesting and all too implementational

## Curly braces 
  - too unwieldy
  - but simple

## Write a program that uses basic arithmetic operators and abs, to write max funtion 
  - Orthogonality is required to write code
  - otherwise it gets too difficult to deal with
  - Here is the solution:

        def max(a,b):
          return (a+b + abs(a-b))/2;
