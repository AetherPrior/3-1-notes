Pseudocodes
  - 1940 - 50 known pseudocodes
    - Better than assembly
  - 1949- Short code
    - Interpreted
    - called Automatic programming
    - no floats

  - 1954 - Speed coding
    - interpreted
    - Easier than Machine language

  - 1951- 53 UNIVAC arithmetic lang?
    - COmpile time - converted lang to machine code

  - 1950-54 Fortran 
    - first compiled High Level programming language
      - Speed of code was advantage
    - IBM 704 computers

     |date|version|
     |---|---|
     |1954|FORTRAN-0|
     |1957|FORTRAN-1|
     |58| <ul><li>f-2</li> <li>independent compilation of subroutines, not total recompile</li></ul>|
     |60-62|f-4 (ansi 66)|
     |77|FORTRAN-77 subroutine to subroutine passing|
     |90|Fortran (note the lowercase change in name)-90 recursive calls|
     |95|f-95 forall iterative|
     |2003|f-2003 object oriented|
     |2008|f-2008 coarray ,concurrent exec|

     - prevalent for 40-50 years
      - compiled, high level
      - imperative language
      - declarative language: tell what should be done, not how to do it (SQL for example)

### LISt Processing - LISP
 - Functional programming languages
 - 1950 - Based on applying functions to arguments
   - Need - Some methods to allow computers to process symbolic data in linked lists
   - at that time, most computations were on data in Arrays
   - required by rule based problem solving domains like in AI

  - scheme lisp
  - common lisp - amalgamation of all lisp flavors - became complex

### ALGOL 58 - ALGOrithmic Language
  - Descendant of fortran 
    - did not become popular - as IBM wanted to use ALGOL
### ALGOL 60
  - Backus-Naur Form
    - Didn't achieve popularity in the US
    - Even in Europe, although more popular in US, and MUCH more popular than ALGOL 58, not popular - too flexible
      - people couldn't understand
    - Input Output wasn't included in Lang spec
      - Different implementations provided differently
      - so less portability
    - IBM didn't support
---
- A programming language
  - Abstract Syntax Tree to parse
  - you use a grammar to describe the language

### COmmon Business-Oriented Language COBOL (1960)
- Progenitor was FLOW-MATIC (early 1950)
- Problem was that computers were used by the scientific community only
  - not much  focus in business areas
- Philosophy: Data processing programs must use English like words rather than mathematical expressions
