https://askubuntu.com/questions/656771/process-niceness-vs-priority

renice - changes the nice value 
renice -n <value> -p <process_id>

chrt -m shows the min and max
chrt -p <ID> shows the policy and priority
chrt -o/*<--this is the scheduler*/ -p <priority> <pid>

each process has its own scheduler

	-  Maybe each algo has its own datastructure
