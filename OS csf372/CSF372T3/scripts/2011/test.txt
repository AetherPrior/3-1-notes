Hello world!
The reason we're writing something inside is because if there's nothing in the memory mapped region, 
you'll not get any output and it'll try to access everything until a bus error happens.
bus errors happen due to an invalid address, when the address doesn't even exist
page fault is about when the page isn't in main memory
