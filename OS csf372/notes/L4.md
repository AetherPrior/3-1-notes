# L4

## Parallel Computing environment
  - Users should feel that they're in control of the system, even though it may be shared
  - Not very important to make an illusion of a single system in a distributed computing environment
  - Each computer has own processor and memory and they can talk to one-another. (it's like a graph)
      
  ### Client-server architecture
  - Client wants service from server
  - requests server to do something on its behalf
  - Server receives request and returns a response
  - Two kinds of servers servernodes: 
    1. compuatation servers
    2. Fileservers
    There can be others, these are simple ones
  - DOS - Denial of service, happens when the server is overwhelmed with requests.
    1. Occurs when users are trying to access a popular link, or it's an attack with malicious intent.
  - Server is a bottleneck here

  ## Peer to peer computing
  - doesn't distinguish clients and servers
  - nodes join and may leave p2p 

## Bootloader program
  ### Bootloader stored in ROM
  ### Before bootloader
  - BIOS - Basic Input/Output System, a firmware
    - special kind of software embedded into the hardware
  1. Performs a Power - on -self -test (POST)
    - Informs the user about devices not working , either as a beep or as an error message
  2. Initialize the hardware devices - cpu regs mem etc.
  3. it loads a special register - the instruction register with a prefixed memory location
     - Memloc contains an initial bootstrap program ( not the whole program, just 1 sector in size)
     - This block is called the bootblock/bootsector/mbr
     - Easy target for virus
- Any disk containing the bootsector is called a bootdisk, and the partition is called a boot-partition
- mostly the block is block #0
4. The initial bootstrap program locates the whole program and loads it
5. this bootstrap program locates the OS and loads it.

## GRUB - GRand Unified Bootloader
  Developed by linux
  1. A bootloader that loads the Bootloaders which different OSs have
  2. Allows to choose a specific kernel config of an OS or Different OSs

# Chapter 3 - Process
## Process
  - A set of steps executed one after the other is a program
  >  A **program under execution** is a process
  - Batch systems - jobs
    - user submits the job and doesn't wait for the output, put into the queue, and at some time it's executed
    - program not expected to execute immediately
  - Time sharing systems (multitasking) - process
    - the process needs to start immediately
  - Multiple parts  
    - each process has an ID
       - Process 1 is init or systemd
    1. Program code - text section
    2. Program counter has the instruction number, processor registers
    3. Stack has temporary data, return address, local variables
    4. containing memory dynamically allocated during run time - when you have calloc or malloc
       - heap is a datastructure where each node has zero to two child nodes

### Process concept
  - Note: stack grows downwards, heap grows upwards
  1. program is passive entity stored on disk - process is active
     - program becomes process when executable file is loaded into memory
     - execution can happen thru command line entry of name/ gui mouse clicks or sth
  2. One program can have several processes of itself
    - Eg. several users can exec same program, but they have unique identifiers, os is treating them as separate stuff

### State of Process
  - note: the names may vary per book
  1. new - the process is being created
     - the process has to wait somewhere to be executed (don't confuse with job, process has already started)
  2. running - the instructions are being executed
     - when it gets a chance to execute
  3. waiting - the process is waiting for some event to occur
     - sometimes the process is waiting for stuff (i/o)
  4. ready: the process is waiting to be assigned to a processor 
     - when the processor is put into the ready-queue
  5. terminated - finished execution

![](@attachment/Clipboard_2020-08-28-15-34-41.png)
- the scheduling mechanism may allow execution only in different chunks
  - once in a while to allow another process, the process should relinquish the state
- from the waiting state, it doesn't transfer **directly to the running state**
- at terminated state, all memory of the process is de-allocated

### Process control block
- process state 
- Program Counter reg
- CPU Regs
- CPU Sched info - priorities and pointers to queues for scheduling -- scheduling queues
- Memory management information - memory allocated to the process m pagetables
- Accounting info - cpu used, clock time etc
- I/O info - devices ready?

### Process Creation
  - Each process has an ID- PID
    - PID Increases by 1 for each 1
  - terminated process's ID isnt recycled
  - A child process can 
     - get same set of resources 
     - or a subset, so that parent process doesn't hog resources
     - or child will have to request the OS 
  - Both can exec concurrently, or parent waits for child
     - P2 will get the same address space (set of memlocs alloc to a process) as P1 (same program and data)
       - or P2 ,the child, is loaded with another program
  - fork -- to create a process
    - after creating the process if you have to load a different process image into the child process you use exec() -- to let the child process do something else
