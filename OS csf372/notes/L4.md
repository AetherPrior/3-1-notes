# L4

## Parallel Computing environment
  - Users should feel that they're in control of the system, even though it may be shared
  - Not very important to make an illusion of a single system in a distributed computing environment
  - Each computer has own processor and memory and they can talk to one-another. (it's like a graph)
      
  ### Client-server architecture
  - Client wants service from server
  - requests server to do something on its behalf
  - Server receives request and returns a response
  - Two kinds of servers servernodes: 
    1. compuatation servers
    2. Fileservers
    There can be others, these are simple ones
  - DOS - Denial of service, happens when the server is overwhelmed with requests.
    1. Occurs when users are trying to access a popular link, or it's an attack with malicious intent.
  - Server is a bottleneck here

  ## Peer to peer computing
  - doesn't distinguish clients and servers
  - nodes join and may leave p2p 

## Bootloader program
  ### Bootloader stored in ROM
  ### Before bootloader
  - BIOS - Basic Input/Output System, a firmware
    - special kind of software embedded into the hardware
  1. Performs a Power - on -self -test (POST)
    - Informs the user about devices not working , either as a beep or as an error message
  2. Initialize the hardware devices - cpu regs mem etc.
  3. it loads a special register - the instruction register with a prefixed memory location
     - Memloc contains an initial bootstrap program ( not the whole program, just 1 sector in size)
     - This block is called the bootblock/bootsector/mbr
     - Easy target for virus
- Any disk containing the bootsector is called a bootdisk, and the partition is called a boot-partition
- mostly the block is block #0
4. The initial bootstrap program locates the whole program and loads it
5. this bootstrap program locates the OS and loads it.
