# L1

OS - set/ suite of tools that allow the function of a computer system

```mermaid
graph TD
Hardware---os---user

```

```mermaid
graph LR
user---application ---os ---computerHardware
```

bootstrap program

- loaded during power on
- on ROM EPROM
- aka firmware

```mermaid
graph TD;
I/O  --- cpu
cpu --- I/O
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram
 LocalBuffer --> MainMemory
 state MainMemory{
  CPU
 }
 MainMemory --> LocalBuffer : Interrupt
```

- Interrupt --> InterruptVector Table

| 1   | 0x000...   |
| --- | ---------- |
| 2   | addr (ISR) |
| 3   | addr       |
| 4   |  ..        |
| 5   |  ..        |

- Interrupt Chaining (Vectortable points to handlers, all are executed till right one happens) -- tradeoff with speed

- Incoming interrupt is disabled when handling other interrupt to prevent lost interrupt
- Trap interrupt -> software interrupt

Interrupt handling

- preserve CPU state

```mermaid
graph TD
a[Determine types of Interrupt]---
b[Polling Collect info of IO devices when ready]
a --- C[vectored -- hardware level]
```

```mermaid
graph LR
A[IO structure]
B[Wait for i/o completion]
C[continue with system program]
A --- B & C
```

Device Status Table

- Maintains Type, state etc. for Each I/O device

```mermaid
stateDiagram
S1-->S4: CPU EXEC CHECK FOR INTR BETWEEN INSTR
S1: Device Init I/O
S2: INitiate I/O
S3: I/O ready
S4: CPU receive intr, tx to interrupt handler
S5: Interrupt handler process data ,returns,
S6: CPU resumes
S1--> S2
S2 --> S3
S3 --> S4
S4 --> S5
S5 --> S6
```

## Von Neumann architecture

## Symmetric multiprocessing

## Clustered computing

- Memory shared by a san (storage area network)
- High availability
- symmetric / asymmetric clusterprocessing available

```mermaid
graph RL
s1[computer] -- interconnect --- s2[Computer] --- s3[..] --- s4[computer]
s1 & s2 & s3 & s4 --- id[(storage)]
```

# OS structure

- Multiprogramming -- Single user can't keep CPU / I/O devices busy at all times
  - aka job scheduler
- Timesharing
  - multitasking aka cpu scheduling

Software error or req creates exception on trap

# 2 modes : User or Kernel

```mermaid
graph LR
subgraph Kernel
b[exec syscall]
end
subgraph User
d[user process exec] --> a[calls syscall]
c[ret from syscall]
end

a[calls syscall] -- trap mode bit 0 --> b
b[exec syscall] -- return mode bit 1 --> c
```
