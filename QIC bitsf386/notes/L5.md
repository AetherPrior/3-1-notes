## Turing machines
 - Strong Church Turing thesis
    - any algorithmic process can be simulated efficiently using a Turing machine
- Modification of the Church Turing Hypothesis
   - States that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method iff it is computable by a Turing machine
 - Quantum computers can disprove that - it can solve some problems more efficiently than a Turing machine

## Information Theory
   - Shannon - mathematical concept of information
     - noiseless channel coding
     - noisy channel coding 
     - Error-correcting codes 
  - Benc Schumacher made a quantum analogue to Shannon's noiseless coding theorem
     - in the process defined the quantum bit or qubit as a tangible physical resource
  - A version of the noisy channel coding theorem is an open problem
