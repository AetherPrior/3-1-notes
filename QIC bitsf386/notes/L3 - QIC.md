# L3 - QIC

$[X,p]$ $=$ $ih/2 \pi$  
$XP - PX \neq 0$

Heisenberg: Matrix mechanics are actually complementary to wave mechnanics of Schrodinger

$H|\psi(t)>= E|\psi(t)>$

# In newtonian mechanics

State of System -- position and momentum

# Wave function

State of the system is a column vector  
Wavefunction is calculated using matrices by plain multiplication:

$\large \psi = \left[\begin{array}{cc}.. & .. \\ .. & ..\end{array}\right]_{n\times n}  \left[\begin{array}{cc} ..\\..\end{array}\right]_{n\times1}$

4 quantum numbers: $|n,l,m,s>$

Pauli exclusion -- no two electrons can have the same quantum number

the spin of adjacent electrons can't be the same

Schrodinger equation doesn't give the spin, but Dirac equation does

# Solvay conference

Einstein team, and Neils Bohr team

Gedanken Experiments - Einstein

Einsten believed quantum mechanics was wrong, then changed his position to it being incomplete

> "does that mean the Moon is not there when I am not looking at it?"

# EPR Paradox

- Let there be 2 identical particles in a quantum system, going in opposite directions, then the measurement of one position immediately determines the position of the other

- Later on, it was called an entangled state, and it didn't violate special relativity
