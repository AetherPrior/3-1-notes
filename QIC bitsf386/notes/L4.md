# L4 
## EPR Paradox
Let Alice and Bob have two systems of different spin and be separated 5000kms

Alice - $|\psi_a> = \alpha_a|\uparrow> + \beta_a|\downarrow>$

Bob - $|\psi_b> = \alpha_b|\uparrow> + \beta_b|\downarrow>$

- Alice -> $\alpha_a$ and $P_\alpha = 0.5$
- Similarly for $\beta_a$

Bob -> $\alpha_b$ and $\beta_b$
  - now if Alice measures her system, she immediately knows the spin of Bob's, who is $5000kms$ away
  - > the communication between Bob and Alice is faster than speed of light, even though Bob didn't measure anything.

## Schrondinger's cat

$| \psi> = |dead,X > + |alive,O>$  

We can represent this as spin, 
  - Bomb burst - 1
  - Bomb not burst - 0

$|Bomb>  = \alpha_1|\uparrow> + \beta_1|\downarrow>$

$|Cat>  = \alpha_2|\uparrow> + \beta_2|\downarrow>$

$|\psi> = |\alpha||\uparrow\uparrow> + |\beta||\downarrow\downarrow>$ 
(Note, the other two states aren't possible i.e. Cat alive with bomb burst, cat ded without bomb burst)

the probability is $|\alpha|^2$
