# L7
- Reasoning =/= Argument
- reasoning is the method to arrive at a conclusion

gambler's fallacy - superstitious.

If probabilities of a situation is 1, the argument isn't actually inductive it becomes deductive - check this lecture

Most-likely - inductive
P1 = Most snake-bites lead to death
P2 = A snake bit John
C = John will most likely die.
  - What IS this lol?
you can have addition of information which can change the conclusion in an inductive argument

If a conclusion does not incontrovertibly follow from the premise, then it's not a good deductive argument. 
The technical term is validity.

All circles have parallel sides. q is a circle. Hence q has parallel sides
valid argument, but premise is false (is it lol? infinite sides).

We cannot use hidden premises
Premise and conclusion can be true, but the argument can be invalid
- Arguments need evidence-based conclusion
- Premises should deal with the truth of the conclusion
- So, the conclusion has to deal with the premises

if the premises are not of a correct form, what can you tell about the argument
