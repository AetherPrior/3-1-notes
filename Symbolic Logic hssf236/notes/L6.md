## Arguments

1. Arguments are **not** statements, they contain the statements. 
2. Arguments can be single sentences but even they can be broken down
3. Statements/claims can be F or T
   - Argument isnt false or true
   - Claims/statements cant be valid/invalid (although it is used) 

4. No fixed number of premises
   - you can have many premises
   - and then a conclusion like "HENCE pigs can fly"
   - the "Hence" - indicator of conclusion makes it look like a conclusion
   - or you need to indicate premises
      - cigarette smoking must be banned, because it causes cancer
      - here the premises are indicated
5. No fixed form of argument in natural language. Premises do not have to precede conclusion

### Examples
- All doges are smol. Hence cate is smol 
   - we don't know if cate is a doge (it's not)
   - argument, but not a good argument
- All humans are mortal. Hence John is mortal
   - assume john is a human 
- Not all premises may be explicitly mentioned^ . Some are hidden/assumed/suppressed

1. We can lend money to John because he is a nice person
   - Nice people can be lent money

2. Because women have a right to their body, abortion should be legal. 
   - abortion is an act on the body

3. Of course the bullet will fall back to earth
   - bad argument, no premise
4. We should not punish the innocent
   - it doesn't even look like an argument acc. to logic, it has to be presented as an argument
   - it's a shitty argument
   - innocents are not criminals
5. logic relies on form, that's why it's FORMal logic

A good understanding of the world is required to consider arguments with hidden premises

therefore $\therefore$
because $\because$

$\large \frac{Premise}{\therefore\: Conclusion}$

### Words to indicate premise:
Since/For/Because/Given that
- For I am the son of a king, you should call me a prince

### Words to indicate conclusion
Therefore/thus/consequently/hence/so

--- 
- However, some MAY look spuriously like conclusion indicators!!!!!

- Since yesterday i am feeling unwell
- Even "thus":
  - Even though John has been rude, you should not speak to him thus (in this manner).
